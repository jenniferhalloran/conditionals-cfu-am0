# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
  * I am pretty confident at the moment, I found them pretty intuitive and it felt natural to use them. I just need to remember to use `==` instead of `=`, which would be for assignment.


1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
  * Logical operators also seem pretty intuitive to me to use, and I like how efficient they are.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
  * Again, I find that if i just speak this out in plain english in my head as I create the code, the `if` statements and `elsif` are pretty intuitive.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
  * I spent about an hour and half on this topic, which I think was a reasonable amount of time for the amount of tasks in the lesson.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  * I am pretty comfortable with this, the only thing I am not happy with is my commits to Github. I got a bit ahead of myself and did not think about how often I should be committing! I think ideally I would have made commits in small chunks, for example dividing comparisons.rb into 3 separate commits for each part. But being that I forgot to commit everything until the end, it gave me practical experience to understand why the staging area in git is so useful because I was able to individually stage and commit each file.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  * Not too much at the moment, but I have been googling many of my questions as I go and then putting the solutions I find to the test in the terminal and it has been working out really well for me.

  After pushing this to github, I did notice that the markdown on this page did not properly translate on github. While the markdown preview shows this with the correct numbering, the git hub does not! Not sure why that happened - will google this and look at the original repo to decipher if it is something on my end.
